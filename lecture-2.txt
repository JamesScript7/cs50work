Week 2: Continuation of C.

A string is an array of characters!

Each character is stored in a 'locker'

----------------------------------
| s | t | e | l | i | o | s | \0 |
----------------------------------

Having things sorted is a powerful ingredient to solving the problem.

so how do you get something sorted?

Insertion sort:
grab one, compare and insert where it belongs.

Bubble sort: O(n^2)
The biggest number 'bubbled up' to the end of the array.
The next iteration will have one less integer to sort through.

Selection sort:
Another method is to search for the smallest number in arr[0] then
continue to arr[1] and search for a number thats smaller than arr[1]
(seems like a lot of work)

Merge sort: O(n log n)
Recursively sort the left half, right half, and merge them together.

Worst case senario = Big O
Best case senario = Big Omega
