Lecture 1 - From Scratch to C

JS
console.log("hello, world");

When green flag clicked in Scratch:

int main(void)


VOCAB:
stdio = standard input output
include = hey computer please include... etc


The forever loop in Scratch:
while (true)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}


The repeat loop in Scratch:
for (int i = 0; i < 50: i++)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}


The if else in Scratch:
if (x < y)
{
  printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else if (x > y)
{
  printf("x is greater than y\n");
}
else
{
  printf("x is equal to y\n");
}


We are writing source code and that needs to be converted to machine code
through compilers.

source code -> compiler -> machine code

We will use cs50's IDE for C programming.
IDE = integrated development environment

hello.c
(General convention: always underscore and no spaces.)

clang hello.c will compile a file: a.out

If you wanted to name the file:
clang -o hello hello.c

In the IDE the green color font with the * next to it means its an
executable file.

Some C functions provided in the <cs50.h> library:
get_char
get_double
get_float
get_int
get_long_long
get_string

printf("hello, %s\n", s);
%s means "put some string here"

<cs50.h> is a header file. It's a summary of the functionality of what
you have access.

DATATYPES reviewed:
strings
integers
floats

If you wanted to add more decimal points then type it like: "%.10f"
